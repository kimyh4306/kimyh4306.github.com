Here are the notes I prepared for the Mung Seminar.
These notes are about Morse theory.
I did not touch upon Morse homology and stable, unstable manifolds on this talk.
Those topics were left for the following talk in the winter.

Most of these notes come from the three books: "Morse Theory", "Lectures on the h-cobordism theorem" by John Milnor,
and "An Introduction to Morse Theory" by Yukio Matsumoto.
