# 1. Free Modules are Projective
This simply means that for a short exact sequence $$\mathcal{0\to M\to N\to F\to 0}$$, where $$\mathcal{F}$$ is free,
the corresponding sequence is also exact: $$\mathcal{0\to Hom() \to \to \to 0}$$

Since $$\mathcal{Ext}$$  measures the failure of exactness for $$\mathcal{Hom}$$,
this means that $$\mathcal{Ext^1_R(F, _)}$$ is zero
