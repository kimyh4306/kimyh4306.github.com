title: Universal Coefficient Theorem For Cohomology
category: Algebraic Topology
description: These are notes for a short talk on the Universal Coefficient Theorem
---

Here are my notes for the joint talk on Algebraic Topology.

We each covered different materials from Hatcher during this undergraduate student seminar.

These are the notes from my talk about the Universal Coefficient Theorem in cohomology.

I omitted the deviations toward homological algebra in these notes.
The book "Algebra: Chapter 0" is strongly recommended for those who wishes to fill those gaps.
